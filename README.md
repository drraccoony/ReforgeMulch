# ReforgeMulch

![ArmaReforgerBloodGulch](img/readmeBanner.png)

Initial attempts to import a Blood Gulch FBX from Halo:CE into the Arma Reforger game using the Reforger Tools. This was done while learning the World Editor IDE toolset and is quite incomplete.

## Getting Started

The `./flipped` directory holds the textures and models from the Blood Gulch FBX file, which had the normals flipped to work properly within the Reforger world editor. `Mp_ReforgeMulchWorld.ent` is a copy of `MPTest.ent` to have the skybox, spawns and other required components needed to test/run the world.
