# ReforgeMulch

Attempts to import a Blood Gulch FBX from Halo:CE into the Arma Reforger game using the Reforger Tools.

## Navigating

The `./flipped` directory holds the textures and models from the Blood Gulch FBX file, which had the normals flipped to work properly within the Reforger world editor. `Mp_ReforgeMulchWorld.ent` is a copy of `MPTest.ent` to have the skybox, spawns and other required components needed to test/run the world.
